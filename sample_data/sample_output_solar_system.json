    "title": "Solar System",
    "summary": "The Solar System is the gravitationally bound system of the Sun and the objects that orbit it. It formed 4.6 billion years ago from the gravitational collapse of a giant interstellar molecular cloud. The Solar System contains eight planets: Mercury, Venus, Earth, Mars, Jupiter, Saturn, Uranus, and Neptune. It also includes dwarf planets, moons, asteroids, comets, and other small bodies.",
